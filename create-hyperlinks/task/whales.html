    <h1>Whales</h1>
    <p>Here we feature information about whales including :</p>

    <h2>Blue whale</h2>
    <p>
      The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal and a baleen
      whale. Reaching a maximum confirmed length of 29.9 meters (98 ft) and
      weighing up to 199 tonnes (196 long tons; 219 short tons), it is the
      largest animal known ever to have existed. The blue whale's long and
      slender body can be of various shades of greyish-blue dorsally and
      somewhat lighter underneath. Four subspecies are recognized: B. m.
      musculus in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, B. m. intermedia in the
      Southern Ocean, B. m. brevicauda (the pygmy blue whale) in the Indian
      Ocean and South Pacific Ocean, B. m. indica in the Northern Indian Ocean.
      There is also a population in the waters off Chile that may constitute a
      fifth subspecies. Learn more

    <h2>Sperm Whale</h2>
    <p>
      The sperm whale or cachalot[a] (Physeter macrocephalus) is the largest of
      the toothed whales and the largest toothed predator. It is the only living
      member of the genus Physeter and one of three extant species in the sperm
      whale family, along with the pygmy sperm whale and dwarf sperm whale of
      the genus Kogia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sperm whale is a pelagic mammal with a worldwide range, and will
      migrate seasonally for feeding and breeding.[5] Females and young males
      live together in groups, while mature males (bulls) live solitary lives
      outside of the mating season. The females cooperate to protect and nurse
      their young. Females give birth every four to twenty years, and care for
      the calves for more than a decade. A mature sperm whale has few natural
      predators, although calves and weakened adults are sometimes killed by
      pods of killer whales (orcas). Learn More
