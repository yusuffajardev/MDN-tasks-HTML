    <p>What causes errors in HTML
        <ul>
            <li>Unclosed elements: if an element is <strong>not closed properly, then its affect can spread to areas you didn't intend</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Badly nested element: nesting elements properly is also very important for code behaving correctly. <strong>strong<em>strong emphasised?</em></strong>  <em>what is this</em></li>
            <li>Unclosed attributes: another common source of HTML problems. Lets look at an example: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Link to mozilla homepage</a></li>
        </ul>
